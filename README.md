Indoor Navigation System
Indoor Navigation System for College (MEAN Stack) This project is an Indoor Navigation System designed to help students, staff, and visitors easily navigate a college campus. Built using the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node.js), the system features an intuitive user interface, responsive design, and real-time integration with the college's database. Users can search for locations, plan routes, and receive navigation assistance. The admin panel allows for managing map data, user permissions, and updating routes to reflect changes in the campus environment. The system ensures fast response times, scalability, and security, providing a reliable and user-friendly experience across devices.
